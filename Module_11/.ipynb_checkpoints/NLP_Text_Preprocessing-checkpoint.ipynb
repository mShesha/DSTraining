    "Text preprocessing is an essential step in natural language processing (NLP) that involves cleaning and transforming unstructured text data to prepare it for analysis. It includes tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop-word removal, and part-of-speech tagging. Here we will introduce the basics of text preprocessing and provide Python code examples to illustrate how to implement these tasks using the NLTK library."

    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Data Science which deals with Text data.

But before using the data for analysis or prediction, processing the data is important.\n",
